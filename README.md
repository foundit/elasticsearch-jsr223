elasticsearch-jsr223
====================

This project is a proof of concept implementation of an Elasticsearch plugin that makes all jsr223 compliant script engines available to use for dynamic scripts in Elasticsearch.

You are welcome to read the code and use it as a head start for making your own plugin, but if you choose to use it as is then be prepared to maintain the code your self. That said, you are still welcome to send issues and pull requests or fork the repository as long as you accept that responses might take a while.
